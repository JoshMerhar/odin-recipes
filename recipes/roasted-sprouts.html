    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These roasted brussels sprouts are super easy to prepare and don't require many ingredients. 
        Even an abject knucklehead like me can consistently make this recipe well. All it really takes 
        is some olive oil, salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of honey, and a total of 30-35 minutes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Get your oven rippin' at 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Halve the sprouts.
        Lay the sprouts flat side down and distribute them evenly across the baking sheet. Drizzle with 
        1 tablespoon of oilive oil. Sprinkle with salt and ground pepper. Push the sprouts around the baking sheet,
        ensuring they all get a coating of oil, salt, and pepper. <strong>Make sure to return all sprouts
        to flat side down before putting them in the oven.</strong>Place in the oven for 11 minutes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After 11 minutes, pull the sprouts from the oven. Scooch them around the baking sheet 
        to prevent them from burning. <strong>Again, make sure they all return to flat side
        down before placing them back into the oven.</strong> Place in the oven for another
        11 minutes. When finished baking, remove from oven. Drizzle with a bit more olive oil,
        no more than 1 tablespoon. Splash with 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, or more if you'd like.
        Drizzle with honey. Serve immediately.
