    <h2>They taste better than they smell. But I've grown to like their funk...</h2>
    <p>
        These roasted brussels sprouts are super easy to prepare and don't require many ingredients. 
        Even an abject knucklehead like me can consistently make this recipe well. All it really takes 
        is some olive oil, salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar, a drizzle of honey, and a total of 30-35 minutes. 
        I make them at least once a week. It's probably the single healthiest thing I routinely consume.
