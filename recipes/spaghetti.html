    <h2>It tastes better when everything is from Whole Foods.</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, I'm just too beat to cook something serious or it's too late to order food. It's times like those
        where trusty Spaghetti and Meatballs save the day. All you need is a box of dried spaghetti, a bag of frozen meatballs,
        and a jar of pasta sauce. It doesn't get much more basic and pathetic than that.
